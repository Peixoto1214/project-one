                My name is Daniel Peixoto. I am originally from Brazil. I move to the USA when I was sixteen to attend high and then college.
                My interest in Web Development started in college after I saw a classmate building a very primitive website with HTML.
                I was intrigued but as you do in college you have to split your focus between lots of things. Being an student athlete I did not have a lot of down time so my desire to pursue Web Development had to sit on the back burner.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, right after last summer I stumbled I started thinking about building a website to host my photography portfolio and then the desire reignited and I decide to figure out how to build and website. Then the website portfolio become less of a priority and I decided to learn this new skill and be prepared for the future.
